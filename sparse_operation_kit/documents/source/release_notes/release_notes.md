# SparseOperationKit Release Notes #
The release notes for SparseOperationKit.

## What's new in Version 1.1.0 ##
+ Supports TensorFlow 1.15.
+ Supports configuring visible devices via `tf.config.set_visible_devices`.
+ Added a dedicated CUDA stream for SOK's Ops.
+ Supports pip installation.
+ Fixed hanging issue in `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` when TensorFlow version greater than 2.4.

## What's new in Version 1.0.1 ##
+ Supports Horovod as the synchronized training communication tool.
+ Supports dynamic input in All2AllDenseEmbedding, which means `unique->lookup->gather` pattern can be used.
+ Supports IdentityHashtable, which means no hash-mapping during inserting new keys.
+ Added TF Distributed Embedding totally with TF's ops.

## What's new in Version 1.0.0 ##
+ Implemented a new framework that can be used to easily integrate different embedding algorithms to common DL frameworks.
+ Supports single-node & multi-node synchronized training with TensorFlow.
+ Integrated HugeCTR's DistributedSparseEmbedding algorithm.
+ Integrated All2AllDenseEmbedding algorithm.
+ Added custom Adam optimizer for SOK when TF version <= 2.4.
